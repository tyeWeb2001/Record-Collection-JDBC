# Record-Collection-JDBC
I have created a RDB using SQL/MySQL Workbench which can be interacted with via a Java Based Application. This Project demonstrates usage Of JDBC , RDB creation and most importantly one of my favourite hobbies record collecting. The SQL dump and RDB designs can also be found in the repository along with the Java code.
Please make sure to install MySQL or similar packages and Host A Local Server Before Running The Java Application.
